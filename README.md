# space_cannon
Space Cannon is a side-scrolling wave shooted game designed in HTML and JavaScript.
The HTML portion of the code provides the backbone of the code, creating the canvas
and importing all of the required image files.
The images files are laid out as sprite sheets to reduced the risk of bad links, 
save storage, and allow for faster edits.
The JavaScript is compressed into a single file. All methods, constants, and objects
are created within the same file, no imports or exports. This again reduces the risk
of bad links breaking down the code. Descriptive comments are left throughout the
program to give explanation on how and why it works like it does.
